Day 4: Docker Architecture & Image Management
Topics Covered
Docker Architecture
Difference between Images and Containers
Docker CLI commands (docker run, build, exec, ps, etc.)

Writing Efficient Dockerfiles:
Best practices (caching layers, minimal base images)
Avoiding unnecessary RUN instructions

Practical Tasks Completed
Built a Docker image for a Flask app using a custom Dockerfile
Understood the impact of each instruction (FROM, RUN, COPY, CMD)


Key Learnings
Image vs Container: Images are blueprints; containers are instances.
Writing cleaner Dockerfile avoids bloated images and reduces build time.
