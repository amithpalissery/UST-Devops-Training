 Day 3: Docker

Date: July 21, 2025

Today, I started exploring Docker, understanding how to use containers for consistent environments and application deployment.

Basic Concepts:

 Images -> Read-only templates for creating containers.
 Containers -> Runnable instances of an image.

Docker Image Management:

 docker pull <image_name>:<tag> -> Download a Docker image from a registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
 docker images -> List all local Docker images.
 docker rmi <image_id> -> Remove (delete) a Docker image.

Docker Container Management:

 docker run <image_name> -> Create and start a new container from an image.
 docker ps -> List all running containers.
 docker ps -a -> List all containers (running and stopped).
 docker stop <container_id> -> Stop a running container.
 docker start <container_id> -> Start a stopped container.
 docker restart <container_id> -> Stop and then start a container.
 docker rm <container_id> -> Delete a stopped container.
 docker logs <container_id> -> View logs of a container.
