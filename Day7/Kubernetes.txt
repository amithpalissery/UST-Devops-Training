Today, I learned about kubernetes basics and tried a few commands to get familiar with it.


Successfully SSH'd into the Kubernetes EC2 instance
Verified kubectl functionality and cluster nodes
Explored core K8s resources: Pods, Deployments, Services, Namespaces
Deployed a simple Nginx application
Created a Deployment
Exposed it via a NodePort Service
Successfully accessed Nginx via browser using EC2 IP and NodePort
Practiced scaling and deleting deployments
Explored kubectl logs and describe commands
