I also successfully deployed a 3-replica Nginx application to Kubernetes, exposed it via a NodePort Service, accessed it via EC2 Public IP, and then cleaned up all resources.
 commands used:
                 kubectl create deployment nginx-deployment --image=nginx --replicas=3 
                 kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment --type=NodePort --port=80

                  kubectl delete service nginx-deployment
                  kubectl delete service nginx-deployment
