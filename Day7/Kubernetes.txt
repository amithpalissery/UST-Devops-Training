Day 7:23/07/25
Today, I learned about kubernetes basics and tried a few commands to get familiar with it.


Successfully SSH'd into the Kubernetes EC2 instance
 couldn't run commands, showing an error
I was because ,i was not logged in as root user, rectified it with sudo su

Tried basic commands like :
                            
                            kubectl get namespace                            
                            kubectl get pods
                            kubectl get deployments
                            kubectl get services
