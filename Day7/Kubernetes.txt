Today, I learned about kubernetes basics and tried a few commands to get familiar with it.


Successfully SSH'd into the Kubernetes EC2 instance
 couldn't run commands, showing an error
I was because ,i was not logged in as root user, rectified it with sudo su

Tried basic commands like :
                            
                            kubectl get namespace                            
                            kubectl get pods
                            kubectl get deployments
                            kubectl get services
I also successfully deployed a 3-replica Nginx application to Kubernetes, exposed it via a NodePort Service, accessed it via EC2 Public IP, and then cleaned up all resources.
 commands used:
                 kubectl create deployment nginx-deployment --image=nginx --replicas=3 
                 kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment --type=NodePort --port=80

                  kubectl delete service nginx-deployment
                  kubectl delete service nginx-deployment
