Day 2: Git

Date: July 20, 2025

Today, I began familiarizing myself with Git, understanding its core commands for version control and collaboration.

Initializing & Basic Workflow:

 git init -> Initialize a new Git repository in the current directory.
 git status -> Show the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
 git add <file> -> Stage changes for the next commit.
 git add . -> Stage all changes in the current directory.
 git commit -m "message" -> Record staged changes to the repository with a descriptive message.

Viewing History & Changes:

 git log -> Display commit history.
 git log --oneline -> Display concise commit history (one line per commit).
 git diff -> Show changes between working directory and staging area.
 git diff --staged -> Show changes between staging area and last commit.
 git diff <commit1> <commit2> -> Show differences between two specific commits.

Branching & Merging:

 git branch -> List all local branches.
 git branch <new_branch_name> -> Create a new branch.
 git checkout <branch_name> -> Switch to a different branch.
 git checkout -b <new_branch_name> -> Create and switch to a new branch.
 git merge <branch_to_merge> -> Integrate changes from a specified branch into the current branch.
 git branch -d <branch_name> -> Delete a local branch (only if merged).
 git branch -D <branch_name> -> Force delete a local branch (even if unmerged).
