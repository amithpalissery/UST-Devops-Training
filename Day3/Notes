Isuue:
 Got issues while running commands
Resolution:
 Added user to docker group using command "sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}", also we need to reconnect to vm to take this in effect.
 without doing that , we may need to add sudo to every commmand.

1.Pulled ubuntu image form docker 
    docker pull ubuntu:latest
2.List downloaded images
     docker images
3.Run an interactive container
   docker run -it ubuntu bash
4.Run a detached container
    docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx:latest
5.List running conatainers
    docker ps
6.stop a container
    docker stop <container_id>
7.Remove a container after stopping it 
   docker rm <container_id>
